E3T file is a material definition file similar to valve's VMT file.
The file is stored in plaintext.
The file is seperated into texture attributes: Albedo, Normal, Reflectivity, Specular, Fresnel term, Transparency, Emission and Height.
Each attribute is optional, when one is missing it will use the default texture's attributes.
Each attribute contains a source directory, a range per dimension, comments, and an end tag.

If the range has only one entry, it is applied to each of the three dimensions of the field.
Data outside the range is clamped to the range, data inside the range is linearly interpolated.

The source directory is surrounded with quotation marks.

Attributes can be duplicated, it will overwrite the previous data entry. Read from top to bottom.

Certain rendering proporties have priority over other proporties, listed from highest priority to lowest:
1. Emission
2. Transparency
3. Reflectivity
4. Diffuse Reflection(albedo)
5. Absorbtion(1-albedo)
Normal and Height are not light rendering textures and are not on this list.


Example:

COMMENT "Reflection textures"
Albedo
src "Albedo.png"
range 0 1 0 1 0 1 0 1

Normal
src "Normal.png"
range -1 1 -1 1 -1 1 -1 1

Reflectivity
src "Reflectivity.png"
range 0 1

Specular
src "Specular.png"
range 0 1

COMMENT "Transmission textures"

Transparency
src "Clear.png"
range 0 1

COMMENT "Emmission textures"

Emission
src "Specular.png"
range 0 800

COMMENT "Geometry textures"

Height
src "Height.png"
range 0 1
